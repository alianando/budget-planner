/*Property: In Dart, a property refers to a characteristic or attribute of an object.
Properties are often associated with classes and instances of those classes.
For example, if you have a Person class, name and age could be properties of an instance of that class.*/
  

/*Type: In Dart, a type refers to the kind of data that a variable can hold or a function can return.
Dart is a statically-typed language, which means that variables have a declared type at compile time.
For example, int, String, bool, etc., are different types in Dart.*/  


/*Keyword: Keywords are reserved words in Dart that have a special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names or class names).
Examples of keywords include var, final, class, if, else, return, etc.*/


/*Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that objects created from the class will have.
Classes are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming.*/
